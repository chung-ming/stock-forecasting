QCOM saw its stock trading at around $128 in late June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing interest rates, and is now 16% below that level, underperforming the broader markets, considering that the S&P 500 rose almost 12% over this period. The decline in Qualcomm stock over the recent past can be attributed to a considerable slowdown in the smartphone and tablet market, amid cooling consumer spending and weaker demand for computing and mobile devices post Covid-19. Over Q3 FY’23, the most recent quarter, Qualcomm reported a mixed set of results with revenue missing estimates, declining by 23% year-over-year to $8.44 billion, although profits came in ahead of estimates. There have been some positive developments for the stock as well, with Qualcomm announcing earlier this month it had extended an agreement with Apple to supply modem chips to the iPhone maker until 2026. Apple was expected to use an internally developed 5G modem starting in 2024 but is apparently facing some setbacks with its development.",,0,0,00914c0a-1a60-4727-b270-4c61e19d60e7

Now, Tesla’s execution has actually been solid this year, with earnings per share poised to almost double year-over-year, despite supply chain challenges. That said, there are multiple headwinds for the stock at present. For one, the demand picture is increasingly challenging. Tesla has slashed prices on its Model 3 and Y vehicles in the U.S. by $7,500 until the end of this year. Tesla has also resorted to discounts in China, and there are reports that the company is reducing its production schedule at its Shanghai plant for January. Price cuts of this magnitude (well over 10% of the vehicle’s sticker price) signal that demand for the company’s EVs is cooling off, meaning that Elon Musk’s forecast of 50% delivery growth over a multi-year period – a key assumption of many Tesla valuation models – looks uncertain. Separately, Elon Musk’s recent acquisition of Twitter also has big implications. Although Mr. Musk purchased the social media company in his personal capacity, the deal is clearly becoming a distraction, reducing his focus on the EV major. Although Mr. Musk has indicated that he would move away from his role as Twitter CEO, we do not think this will happen, given the sizable financial commitments he has made in the Twitter deal.",,0,0,12fcb4f3-1e1d-4692-8ebd-2cd90c2030cc

This compares to the S&P 500 which has gained about 7% over the same period. The stock was also up by about 6% over the last week (five trading days). The recent rally comes as Apple’s Q4 FY’22 results came in ahead of expectations, in contrast with fellow tech titans Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta, who all missed estimates, amid weaker demand and easing Covid-19 tailwinds. Over Q4, Apple’s revenues stood at $90.1 billion, up about 8% year-over-year, and EPS came in at $1.29, up about 3% versus last year. However, growth rates for Apple’s bread-and-butter iPhone businesses fell short of estimates as interest in entry level models was weak, although premium devices such as the iPhone Pro apparently saw a stronger uptake. Apple’s services business has also seen a meaningful slowdown, with year-over-year growth coming in at just 5%, compared to double-digit levels in previous quarters.",,0,0,0a070c30-3d1a-4944-86e1-6399cd0fe334

While technology names, in general, have taken a hit due to rising interest rates and concerns about the broader economy, Apple supplier stocks fell recently amid reports that demand for the latest iPhone 14 handsets, which were launched earlier this month, remains weaker than expected. Per Bloomberg, Apple has asked its suppliers to hold off on plans to raise production of the iPhone 14 series by as many as 6 million units over the second half of the year. According to the report, Apple now aims to produce about 90 million handsets for the period, roughly flat versus last year.  Moreover, Apple has essentially kept prices for its new iPhones flat over the last few years, while investors were actually expecting a price hike this time around.

Moreover, the macroeconomic environment also remains tough, with U.S. GDP contracting over the last two quarters, and surging inflation eating into household budgets.

Apple’s margins have also expanded considerably, with gross margins as of Q2 FY’22 standing at 43.7%, driven by a more favorable product mix, higher services sales, and rising volumes, up from around 38% in FY’19. However, investors are concerned about whether the momentum will hold up. The U.S. economy could be headed into a recession, as the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates at a more aggressive pace to tame surging inflation. The central bank just carried out a 0.75% hike last week, its highest since 1994, and more similar hikes are looking likely in the coming months.  Consumer confidence is also on the decline, as surging energy, grocery, and housing prices eat into household budgets.
