We expect Salesforce to edge past the consensus estimates. The company surpassed the street expectations in the last quarter, with total revenues increasing 14% y-o-y to $8.38 billion. It was because of a 14% increase in the subscription & support revenues and a 19% rise in the professional services & other segment. The subscription & support revenues benefited from growth in all the sub-segments – sales cloud, marketing & commerce cloud, service cloud, platform & other, and data. We expect the same trend to continue in Q1 (Note – Salesforce’s FY’23 ended on January 31, 2023. Q1 FY’24 refers to the quarter that ended on April 30, 2023).",,0,0,fab4352d-f13d-4d82-8bb9-22fd70d91c31

On the cost front, operating expenses as a % of revenues witnessed a unfavorable increase, mainly due to higher research & development expenses.

Investors of all stripes can make good use of this asset manager’s wide variety of investment strategies—offered up in simple, cost-effective ETFs. The best Vanguard ETFs are big and “liquid,” meaning they are easy to buy and sell. They’re also a key part of any low-cost investing strategy; that’s because most Vanguard ETFs are inexpensive index funds that are frequently the cheapest alternatives in the marketplace. So, if you’re trying to build a portfolio without getting drained by fees, read on as we evaluate some of the best Vanguard ETFs for 2023. We’ve got something for everyone—whether you care about emerging markets or developed markets, small-cap stocks for growth or solid blue-chip stocks for the dividends, there’s a Vanguard ETF out there for you. We’ll start with a little ETF education, then move on to the picks. Disclaimer: This article does not constitute individualized investment advice. These funds appear for your consideration and not as investment recommendations. Act at your own discretion. Related: The Best Vanguard Index Funds for Beginners What Is an ETF? We’ll start with the most basic of basics: “ETF” is an acronym for an “exchange-traded fund.” In plain English, that means it’s a grouping of different assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) into a fund—one that’s listed on an exchange, just like individual stocks. As such, an ETF can fluctuate in price across the trading day according to the value of those underlying assets. ETFs vs. mutual funds You might be familiar with this concept of bundled assets because that’s how traditional mutual funds work. But with mutual funds, all buying and selling happens just once each trading day, after the markets close at 4 p.m. ETFs, on the other hand, are available to buy and sell across the trading day. ETFs are also structured differently than mutual funds and their other cousins, closed-end funds (CEFs), which tends to make them a little more tax-efficient. Also, unlike mutual funds, ETFs don’t have minimum investment thresholds—the minimum cost is just one share (or less if your broker offers fractional shares). Lastly, ETFs tend to have cheaper fees than mutual funds, on average, but that’s because most ETFs are passively managed index funds, whereas most mutual funds are run by one or more human managers. But there are more expensive actively managed ETFs and cheap index mutual funds. Why Vanguard? Vanguard is the No. 2 asset manager",,0,0,5c66c127-e18c-4287-bfb8-a632cb00a133

They can be held in virtually any brokerage account or IRA, often sport very attractive yields, and, if timed well, they can also generate solid trading returns. And if you can think of an asset class, chances are good there is a CEF trading it. Closed-end funds can hold stocks, corporate bonds, tax-free municipal bonds and virtually every other asset under the sun, including illiquid assets that are hard to own within a traditional mutual fund. But what exactly is a closed-end fund, and how do you know what constitutes a good one? Today, we’re going to break down this market niche, then we’ll present you with seven of the best CEFs for 2023. Disclaimer: This article does not constitute individualized investment advice. These funds appear for your consideration and not as investment recommendations. Act at your own discretion. What Is a Closed-End Fund? A closed-end fund is a special type of fund that shares certain things in common with their cousins: traditional open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But there are also critical differences that make CEFs very different from both. CEFs vs. mutual funds vs. ETFs CEFs are best understood by comparing them to the competition. You’re likely very familiar with open-end mutual funds, which are the investment vehicle of choice for 401(k)s and other retirement plans. But you may not actually understand how they work. Related: 20 Best Investing Research & Stock Analysis Websites When you invest in an open end mutual fund, you (or your broker) actually sends cash to the fund, which the manager then uses to buy stocks, bonds or other securities. And when you redeem, the mutual fund manager will send you or your broker the cash, even selling securities to free it up if need be. Exchange-traded funds are different. Investors can buy or sell ETFs exactly as they would any stock. They trade on major stock exchanges. Unlike mutual funds, you don’t actually send the manager money. New ETF shares can be created or destroyed by institutional investors based on market demand. (When shares are created, an institutional investor will essentially buy up the shares of stocks and bonds owned by the ETF, then trade them to the fund for shares of the ETF itself. When shares are destroyed, the institutional investor receives the underlying holdings.) This creation",,0,0,b5db2325-7567-4a17-8763-2fdeaca53928

We expect Oracle to edge past the consensus estimates of revenues and earnings. The technology giant posted mixed results in the last quarter, with revenues meeting expectations but earnings missing the mark. It reported total revenues of $11.45 billion – up 18% y-o-y, mainly driven by a 14% increase in the cloud services and license support revenues and a 74% jump in the services segment. The services unit benefited from the Cerner acquisition and revenue growth in each of the primary services offerings. We expect the same trend to continue in the second quarter (Note – Oracle’s FY’22 ended on May 31, 2022. Q2 FY’23 refers to the quarter that ended on November 30, 2022).",,0,0,94357d48-73d0-49ac-b338-1b00a41d5a87

Further, at its current price of $371 per share, it is trading 19% below its fair value of $456 – Trefis’ estimate for Adobe’s valuation. The technology giant topped the consensus estimates for revenues and earnings in the second quarter. It posted a 14% y-o-y increase in total revenues to $4.4 billion, driven by a 15% growth in digital media and a 17% rise in the digital experience segments. Notably, the digital media division contributes more than 70% of the top line. It benefited from a 12% increase in the creative cloud and a 27% jump in the document cloud categories. Further, the digital media ARR (annualized recurring revenue) grew from $12.15 billion to $12.95 billion at the end of Q2. Similarly, the digital experience segment profited from an 18% improvement in subscription-based revenues. Overall, the above growth translated into a 6% y-o-y increase in the net income to $1.18 billion. It was primarily due to higher expenses as a % of revenues. (Note – Adobe’s FY’21 ended on December 3, 2021. Q2 FY’22 refers to the quarter that ended on June 03, 2022)",,0,0,85d29401-d89c-4bf0-b1dd-24546e5d3630
