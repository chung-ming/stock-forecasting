Carlyle Group Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.325 on 8/16/22, Navios Maritime Partners LP will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.05 on 8/12/22, and Alcoa Corporation will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.10 on 8/25/22. As a percentage of CG's recent stock price of $38.31, this dividend works out to approximately 0.85%, so look for shares of Carlyle Group Inc to trade 0.85% lower — all else being equal — when CG shares open for trading on 8/8/22. Similarly, investors should look for NMM to open 0.17% lower in price and for AA to open 0.21% lower, all else being equal."

2021-11-17T08:00:00.000+08:00,Alcoa Stock Above $50 – What’s Behind This Surge?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-stock-above-%2450-whats-behind-this-surge,,,"Alcoa stock (NYSE: AA) has jumped 8.5% in just the last one week and has surpassed $50 level, outperforming the S&P 500 which declined marginally in the last week. If you look at the change in the stock over the last ten days and one month, AA stock has increased (13% and 6.8%, respectively) and outperformed the broader market on both occasions. The recent increase in stock price was mainly after a Jefferies analyst upgraded Alcoa stock to “buy” from “hold” and boosted the price target from $52 to $60.  Following the push for decarbonization, the outlook for aluminum has become more positive. Aluminum is a critical metal for decarbonization and will likely continue to see increased demand compared to steel given its lightness (aluminum is about one-third the weight of steel) and easy recyclability. The push for electric vehicles will also drive demand for aluminum as EVs contain 30% more aluminum compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. Additionally, Alcoa has decided to restart 35,000 tons of curtailed capacity at its Portland Aluminum joint venture in Australia next year onward.

Alcoa stock (NYSE: AA) has jumped 8.5% in just the last one week and has surpassed $50 level, outperforming the S&P 500 which declined marginally in the last week. If you look at the change in the stock over the last ten days and one month, AA stock has increased (13% and 6.8%, respectively) and outperformed the broader market on both occasions. The recent increase in stock price was mainly after a Jefferies analyst upgraded Alcoa stock to “buy” from “hold” and boosted the price target from $52 to $60.

The sharp rally was driven by an increase in global aluminum prices. The gradual lifting of lockdowns, widening coverage of vaccines against Covid-19, and stimulus measures have led to optimism in the markets of faster economic recovery. Additionally, the near bipartisan passage of the U.S. infrastructure bill in the Senate has led to expectations of higher demand for steel, aluminum, copper, etc. which has driven the rally in global prices of commodities. Aluminum price per ton has increased almost 20% in the last six months from $2,130 to $2,555, and over the last one year the price of aluminum is up more than 40%. This has also helped Alcoa record its highest profitability since the time the old Alcoa was split up into two entities – Arconic and present-day Alcoa in 2016, with a net income margin of 11% and EPS of $1.63 in Q2 2021. But will Alcoa’s stock continue its upward trajectory over the coming weeks, or is a correction in the stock more likely?","Alcoa stock (NYSE: AA) has seen a large rise of 80% in the last six months and currently trades at $41 per share.

The stock completely outperformed the market (S&P 500) which went up only 1.5% during this time. The recent rally was driven by strong Q1 2021 results. Alcoa’s Q1 2021 revenue and earnings have been the highest since 2018. It recorded revenue of $2,870 million in Q1 2021, reflecting a rise of 21% y-o-y. This was driven by higher prices and strong shipment growth. Net income more than doubled to $175 million, while EPS also increased by the same rate to $0.93 in Q1 2021. Alcoa also stated that it has signed agreements to repower Portland Aluminum smelter in the State of Victoria in Australia. Additionally, aluminum prices have remained strong over recent months and have, in fact, gone up 3% last week. Prices are likely to remain elevated over the next two years driven by higher demand. Higher aluminum price realization has led to expectations of improvement in Alcoa’s free cash flow, which the company is likely to use for deleveraging. Thus, expectations of improvement in fundamentals (proof of which is the strong Q1 2021 performance), stronger balance sheet and overall positive sentiment with respect to global aluminum prices, have led to a surge in Alcoa’s stock price over the last week.","Additionally, aluminum prices have remained strong over recent months and have, in fact, gone up 3% last week.

Despite 5% higher aluminum prices sequentially at around $125 per tonne, weaker demand from packaging, industrial, and commercial transportation markets impacted on results. While weak demand from the packaging segment can be attributed to seasonality, we think that the demand trends in the industrial segment and the commercial transportation segment are reflective of the general state of the economy."

Metlife has just released a study showing almost one-half (45%) of 65-year-old Boomers are now fully retired (up from 19% in 2008). The vast majority of Boomers (63%) have also started receiving Social Security benefits, and of those, half started collecting before they had originally planned. Why is this number so high? Well, almost four in 10 respondents (37%) who retired earlier than they had planned cited health-related issues as the main reason."

Technically, the Dow could find support at the 10K level, with short-term support emerging near 9,900 should selling pressure reemerge.

Heading into the open, Wall Street appears to still be digesting Wednesday's impressive rally, as futures on the DJIA and SPX are trading essentially flat compared to fair value. Finally, the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) retreated from the round-number 30 level yesterday, breaching former support in the 27-28 region.
