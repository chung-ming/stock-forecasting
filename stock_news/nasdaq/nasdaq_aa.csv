Now, the broader markets have taken a hit in recent weeks, amid concerns about a U.S. recession in 2023.  The Federal Reserve is also continuing with its hawkish stance with plans of further rate hikes, despite the moderating pace of inflation and this is likely to weigh on demand for industrial commodities. Aluminum prices have also declined from around $2,500 per ton in early December to about $2,400 currently and remain well below levels of over $3,000 per ton seen in early 2022. Moreover, aluminum output from China has also been expanding, driven by relaxed power restrictions and new capacity coming online. Over November 2022, China’s primary aluminum production was up by 9.4% year-over-year. While the impact of this on prices is likely to be partly alleviated by China’s move to raise tariffs on aluminum exports, this could be a negative for the aluminum market.",,,,

The rally was mainly driven by a significant rise in global aluminum price, which is just shy of $3,000/ton. The price of aluminum per ton has gone up from $2,250 to $2,958 in the last six months, reflecting a rise of over 30%. If you look at the rise in iron ore price over the last one year, it is up almost 60%. The gradual lifting of lockdowns, widening coverage of vaccines against Covid-19, stimulus measures, and new infrastructure plan in the U.S. have led to optimism in the markets of faster economic recovery. The rise in aluminum prices has also helped Alcoa record its highest profitability since the time the old Alcoa was split into two entities – Arconic and present-day Alcoa, in 2016, with a net income margin of 11% and EPS of $1.63 in Q2 2021. The company is likely to maintain such elevated levels of EPS in the Q3 2021 earnings, due this week.

Additionally, the stimulus measures will drive infrastructure spending which has led to the rally in global prices of commodities.

This drop was in line with an overall bearish sentiment for metals during the week. This was driven by two primary factors – China and the U.S.  China stepped up its fight against soaring commodity prices with a warning of zero tolerance for monopoly and hoarding. China primary aluminum production reached a record high in April 2021, marking a rise of 2.3% m-o-m and 12.4% y-o-y. This was in line with rising demand and expectations of more stimulus measures, which led to a commodity price rally, before Chinese authorities intervened last week. Secondly, U.S. President Biden’s spending plan is apparently being scaled back from $2.25 trillion to $1.7 trillion after facing opposition from Republicans. Most of the cuts will include the most important parts for metals consumption, like broadband, roads, and bridges. These two important factors from the U.S. and China has led to a pull back in commodity prices. Accordingly, global aluminum prices fell 4% in the last one week, which led to Alcoa stock dropping more than 10%.",,,,

The stock completely outperformed the market (S&P 500) which went up only 1.5% during this time. The recent rally was driven by strong Q1 2021 results. Alcoa’s Q1 2021 revenue and earnings have been the highest since 2018. It recorded revenue of $2,870 million in Q1 2021, reflecting a rise of 21% y-o-y. This was driven by higher prices and strong shipment growth. Net income more than doubled to $175 million, while EPS also increased by the same rate to $0.93 in Q1 2021. Alcoa also stated that it has signed agreements to repower Portland Aluminum smelter in the State of Victoria in Australia. Additionally, aluminum prices have remained strong over recent months and have, in fact, gone up 3% last week. Prices are likely to remain elevated over the next two years driven by higher demand. Higher aluminum price realization has led to expectations of improvement in Alcoa’s free cash flow, which the company is likely to use for deleveraging. Thus, expectations of improvement in fundamentals (proof of which is the strong Q1 2021 performance), stronger balance sheet and overall positive sentiment with respect to global aluminum prices, have led to a surge in Alcoa’s stock price over the last week.",,,,
