There have been a couple of developments for Alibaba in recent weeks. Firstly, the company posted a relatively mixed set of Q2 FY’24 results. While revenue missed estimates, rising 9% year over year to RMB 224.8 billion (about $31 billion), earnings came in better than expected at RMB 40.2 billion ($5.5 billion), or $2.14 per American Depositary Share (ADS). All the company’s key business segments grew year-over-year, although growth rates cooled off considerably compared to Q1. Separately, Alibaba also announced that it would be scrapping its plans to spin off its cloud unit, citing that the recent expansion of U.S. restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor chips was hurting the business. The spin-off was intended to unlock value for investors given that the Cloud segment included the cloud computing and artificial intelligence business, two high-profile and growing businesses. Moreover, the cloud spinoff was seen as a significant step toward Alibaba’s plans of restructuring itself into a holding company via IPOs for its individual business groups (including e-commerce, media, and food delivery, logistics). This restructuring was seen as helping to reduce the overall conglomerate discount placed on Alibaba’s stock and allowing investors to better value businesses individually. Now the scrapping could indicate that things may not be going as expected.",,,,

There was much to like about Roku’s numbers. Revenues came in at $912 million, up by 20% versus last year and well ahead of the roughly $860 million consensus estimates. The market for video advertising has shown signs of a rebound, following a tough couple of quarters, with Roku also seeing higher content distribution sales. Platform revenue was up by 18% versus last year. Roku also added more new users than anticipated, with the total user base standing at 75.8 million, a net increase of 2.3 million active accounts from the previous quarter. This helped to more than offset a 7% decline in average revenue per subscriber. On the hardware front, Roku is seeing a strong uptake for its Roku branded TVs, which launched earlier this year with the sets accounting for a greater portion of net additions compared to the company’s streaming boxes in international markets over the last quarter. Investors are also likely pleased with the performance of Roku’s proprietary streaming offering, the Roku Channel. In Q3, the company reported a notable surge of over 50% in streaming hours on the channel versus the previous year. In September, the Roku Channel accounted for nearly 3% of all TV streaming, a metric that appears to be in line with the levels of engagement observed on other prominent streaming services, such as Paramount+, Peacock, and Max.

TGT stock has declined from around $149 to nearly $119 YTD, compared to a 14% growth in the S&P index. The stock decline during this period can be attributed to shifting consumer sentiment and slowing company sales. Consumers are still pulling back on discretionary purchases. Target’s Q2 revenue fell 5% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $25 billion due to a 5.4% decline in comparable sales. Further, comparable digital sales also fell 10.5% in Q2. However, the retailer lapped a period with unusually high inventory levels in the year-ago quarter and made progress on initiatives to improve its gross profit margin. Same-day fulfillment services, a longtime source of strength for the company, was up 4% with a 7% increase in Drive-Up. TGT reduced its inventory by 17% y-o-y, which helped drive gross margin up from 21.5% in Q2 2022 to 27% in Q2 2023. Consequently, Target’s operating income improved by 360 basis points to 4.8% and adjusted earnings per share quadrupled from $0.39 in Q2 2022 to $1.80 in Q2 2023. Having said that, the company’s next few quarters could show sluggish sales trends that reflect weak demand for some key product lines. We expect the company shares to likely remain under pressure in the short term.",,,,

These upgrades to the status quo generally open the doorway to vast opportunities, both personally and financially. The most significant that has occurred in my lifetime was the creation of the internet in December of 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Sure, the internet existed before this, dating as far back as the 1950’s with the Department of Defense, however Berners-Lee proposed the system of HTTP and URL structure as well as the term World Wide Web. This gave the world access to an abundance of information. Fast forward 33 years, and most of us are sitting next to at least 5 devices that are connected to the internet. Right now, my watch, Phone, laptop, TV, Amazon Alexa’s (I have 4 of them), dog collar, doorbell, security camera’s, printers, and DJ equipment, are all connected via the internet. Each one of these represented an investment opportunity at some point. The big question is, did you see it coming and did you invest in it back in the 1990’s? While you may have bought a couple stocks, you probably didn’t see the future magnitude of these companies and most likely sold your shares long ago. While many companies have disappeared, others like Amazon and Ebay have amassed incredible fortunes to those who held on. Amazon alone is up over 177,000% since its IPO in 1998.",,,,

The company surpassed the consensus estimates in the first quarter of 2023. The net revenues marginally increased to $2.5 billion, primarily because of a higher take rate (net revenues divided by gross merchandise value) driven by the expansion of payment services and promoted listing products.

On the cost front, the operating expenses as a % of revenues increased in the quarter, but the negative impact was more than offset by higher gains on equity investments – from -$2.3 billion to $198 million.

TGT saw its stock trading at around $139 in the middle of June 2022, when the Fed kept increasing rates, and now remains marginally below those levels. In comparison, the S&P 500 gained about 20% during this period. Target’s stock hasn’t seen much improvement because the retailer continues to have many headwinds. The company’s comparable-store sales were up a disappointing 1% in Q1 2023, mainly thanks to softness in areas like home furnishings and decorations. Customer traffic rose at the same sluggish rate. In addition, some consumers are boycotting Target to punish the company for displays and merchandise that support certain social communities. There is no denying that Target finds itself in culture wars on social media, which is affecting its brand. Still, we believe that these roadblocks will likely be short lived and the company will recover its prior earnings power thanks to the combination of its rising prices, current lower inventory, and slowing cost inflation.",,,,

204245.0,2023-04-17 00:00:00 UTC,What’s Next For Target Stock After A 32% Fall In The Last Year?,AMZN,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-next-for-target-stock-after-a-32-fall-in-the-last-year,,,"After a 32% decline in the last twelve months, at the current price of around $163 per share, we believe Target (NYSE: TGT), the second-largest discount chain in the U.S. – could see modest gains in the long term. TGT stock has declined from around $237 to nearly $163 in the last twelve months, compared to a 6% fall in the S&P index. The stock decline during this period can be attributed to a slowing economy, supply chain worries, and shifting consumer sentiment. Shoppers were focused on staples and less interested in many of Target’s more discretionary categories like home furnishings. Target’s accelerating promotions to help resolve a mishandled inventory situation from earlier in FY 2022, and higher spending on fuel, freight, transportation, and increased compensation in distribution centers weighed heavily on the company’s profitability. Consequently, Target’s operating income plummeted 57% year-over-year (y-o-y) in FY’22, coming in at a meager $3.85 billion, an operating income margin of just 3.5% (compared to 8% the previous year in FY’21). Also, its adjusted earnings per share were chopped by half to $6.02 in FY 2022 from $13.56 in FY 2021. Despite rising costs, Target’s revenue rose 3% y-o-y to $109 billion in FY’22 on the back of a 2.2% increase in comparable sales. It should be noted that TGT’s traffic rose almost 2.1% (on a 12.3% spike the previous year) in FY’22, meaning that the company is still able to retain the interest of its shopper base. Target’s customer loyalty, light inventory levels, and higher revenue due to omnichannel initiatives and brand partnerships could likely drive the stock higher in the longer term. However, as long as its base level of profitability remains uncertain, shares will remain under pressure.",,,,

Shopify’s Q4 2022 results were stronger than expected, with revenue rising 26% with sales rising to $1.7 billion, slightly ahead of consensus estimates. Gross merchandise volume on the Shopify platform also rose 13% to $61 billion, ahead of consensus forecasts.

Shopify’s earnings also beat estimates standing at $0.07 per share, compared to the consensus which was projecting a small loss. Separately, inflation has also been cooling, with the supply chain snags seen through Covid-19 also easing.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has scaled back on the pace of its interest rate hikes, with the most recent hike standing at 0.25%, down from multiple rate hikes of 0.75% last year.
