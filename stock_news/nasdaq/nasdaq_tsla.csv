2129921.0,2023-12-07 00:00:00 UTC,XPeng Deliveries Surge Almost 2.5x. What's Next For The Stock?,TSLA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xpeng-deliveries-surge-almost-2.5x.-whats-next-for-the-stock,,,"Chinese luxury electric vehicle maker Xpeng stock (NYSE:XPEV)  had a stellar November, selling a record 20,041 vehicles, up 2.4x from last year. This also marks a slight increase from the 20,002 vehicles the company delivered in October. Growth was driven primarily by the G6 Ultra Smart Coupe – the company’s fifth model, which goes head to head with Tesla’s popular Model Y vehicle.The G6 remains the best-selling battery electric SUV in China in the RMB 200,000 to RMB 250,000 price segment ($27,500 to $34,300). Xpeng’s delivery growth was well ahead of rival Nio which delivered 15,959 vehicles for November, marking an increase of 12% from November 2022. However, Li Auto stock (NASDAQ:LI) remains the largest and fastest growing of the three luxury EV players, delivering 41,030 vehicles, a solid increase of 2.7x versus last year. Li has benefited from demand for its unique vehicles which combine gasoline generators with batteries to extend the range of EVs and reduce range anxiety. Despite the strong recent performance, XPEV stock has suffered a sharp decline of 65% from levels of $45 in early January 2021 to around $15 now, vs. an increase of about 20% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the decrease in XPEV stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 18% in 2021, -80% in 2022, and 63% in 2023 (YTD). In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 19% in 2023 (YTD) – indicating that XPEV underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 – in good times and bad – has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could XPEV face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months – or will it see a recovery?",,,,

This follows a difficult 2022, which saw the theme decline by 21%. Now the macro-environment has actually been somewhat favorable for technology and futuristic stocks, with inflation cooling, and the Federal Reserve scaling back on its pace of interest rate hikes. Things have also been strong on the EV adoption front. For example, in the U.S. battery electric vehicle sales rose 57% year-over-year in Q2 2023, per Counterpoint, with sales accounting for about 7% of overall auto shipments in the country. That said, there have been challenges as well. Earlier this month, the United Auto Workers went on strike, marking the first time workers at all three big Detroit auto companies – Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis – have gone on strike at the same time. This is likely to hurt automotive production and the broader ecosystem in the near term. Separately, price cuts in the EV space by bellwether Tesla over the last two quarters have triggered a price war of sorts, particularly in the sizable Chinese EV market.  This could be weighing on supplier stocks to an extent, as lower selling prices could mean more stringent component cost management on the part of OEMs.",,,,

What Does This Mean For The Stock,TSLA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/teslas-delivery-growth-surpasses-estimates.-what-does-this-mean-for-the-stock,,,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its deliveries for Q2 2023, compared to last year, surge by 83% to 466,140 units. While the growth rates were driven in part by a favorable comparison with Q2 2022 when the company’s Chinese business declined sharply amid strict Covid-19-related lockdowns, Tesla has also likely benefited from price cuts on popular models and an expansion of manufacturing capacity. Tesla has cut prices on its vehicles multiple times over the last two quarters, with popular models such as the Model Y selling at more than 20% below last year’s prices. Moreover, the Model 3 and Y are also eligible for the $7,500 tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and this is also making Tesla’s EVs more accessible to a broader customer base. The ramp-up of production at Tesla’s factory in Texas is also helping supply to an extent. With the Q2 tally, Tesla’s total deliveries for the first half of the year stand at about 889,000, meaning that the company should be roughly on track for a 2 million delivery target for 2023 if the momentum holds up. The delivery numbers should also put Tesla on course to meet its 50% long-term compounded growth rate target this year.",,,,

There are multiple factors driving the recent gains for Tesla. Firstly, the company’s Q4 2022 results were better than anticipated, with revenue growing 33% year-over-year to $24.3 billion, driven by higher deliveries. Adjusted earnings stood at $1.19 per share, marking a 40% year-over-year increase. Moreover, there are indicators that the deep price cuts that Tesla carried out over the last two months are stoking demand. For example, Tesla said that the rate at which orders were coming in as of January was roughly double its production rate. The company also indicated that it could deliver two million cars in 2023, up from around 1.3 million in 2022, provided that there are no external disruptions. The broader macro environment also appears to be helping Tesla stock. The U.S. Federal Reserve has slowed down its pace of interest rate hikes, with the most recent increase standing at just 25 basis points. The broader positive sentiment appears to have helped TSLA disproportionately, considering that it is a high-growth stock that still remains down by almost 50% from its 2021 highs.",,,,

Now, Tesla’s execution has actually been solid this year, with earnings per share poised to almost double year-over-year, despite supply chain challenges. That said, there are multiple headwinds for the stock at present. For one, the demand picture is increasingly challenging. Tesla has slashed prices on its Model 3 and Y vehicles in the U.S. by $7,500 until the end of this year. Tesla has also resorted to discounts in China, and there are reports that the company is reducing its production schedule at its Shanghai plant for January. Price cuts of this magnitude (well over 10% of the vehicle’s sticker price) signal that demand for the company’s EVs is cooling off, meaning that Elon Musk’s forecast of 50% delivery growth over a multi-year period – a key assumption of many Tesla valuation models – looks uncertain. Separately, Elon Musk’s recent acquisition of Twitter also has big implications. Although Mr. Musk purchased the social media company in his personal capacity, the deal is clearly becoming a distraction, reducing his focus on the EV major. Although Mr. Musk has indicated that he would move away from his role as Twitter CEO, we do not think this will happen, given the sizable financial commitments he has made in the Twitter deal.",,,,

Firstly, there are real concerns that demand could be slowing down, particularly in China, which has been a big source of growth for Tesla. The company cut prices of its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China in October, and Bloomberg recently reported that Tesla has planned to scale back production of the Model Y by 20% at its Shanghai factory. Separately, Tesla continues to be weighed down by CEO Elon Musk’s recent acquisition of the social media app Twitter.  Although Mr. Musk purchased the social media company in his personal capacity, he has been offloading Tesla stock to fund the purchase and free up liquidity to manage the loss-making social media company, which has a massive debt load.

There are multiple factors weighing on the stock. Firstly, Tesla continues to be weighed down by CEO Elon Musk’s recent acquisition of the social media app Twitter.  Although Mr. Musk purchased the social media company in his individual capacity, he offloaded Tesla shares to fund the purchase and free up liquidity to manage the loss-making social media company, which has a massive debt load. In early November, he sold another 19.5 million Tesla shares, per an SEC filing, in a transaction worth $3.95 billion. The Twitter acquisition might also be seen as an unwanted distraction for Mr. Musk, forcing him to take time away from his role at Tesla. Separately, there are also concerns that Tesla’s growth could cool off amid a broader economic slowdown, particularly in markets like China. Tesla cut prices of its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China in October and  Chinese tech media Huxiu reports that another price cut could be around the corner.",,,,

So what are some of the trends driving Rivian stock recently? Firstly, Rivian is considering laying off around 5% of its workforce, per a report from Bloomberg, with the layoffs apparently focused on non-manufacturing areas. Rivian’s operating expenses have been elevated, with the company burning about $1.5 billion in cash over Q1 2022 and these cuts could help to reduce costs without impacting production. There are also signs that the company’s production is picking up. Rivian recently announced that it produced 4,401 vehicles over Q2, a 70% sequential increase, and reiterated that it would meet its production target of 25,000 vehicles for this year. There are indicators that the broader semiconductor shortage could also be easing and this might also prove to be a tailwind for the company’s production. Now, although there are concerns about the global economy and broader automotive sales, with most mainstream auto stocks fairing poorly over the last month, Rivian should be somewhat immune to near-term headwinds, given that demand is considerably outstripping supply at this juncture, with the company holding an estimated 90,000 reservations for its premium trucks as of early May.",,,,
