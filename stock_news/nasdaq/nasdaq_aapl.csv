While tech stocks in general have been impacted by rising interest rates,  there are multiple other factors weighing on Roku. Firstly, the company was impacted by supply chain-related issues in its streaming hardware business as well as lower subscriber growth following the easing of the Covid-19 restrictions. Moreover, the digital ad market is cooling off as the U.S. economy faces mounting headwinds.  This is impacting discretionary spending by consumers and hurting marketers’ ad budgets. For the all-important holiday quarter, Roku has projected revenue of just about $800 million, marking a decline of about 7.5% versus last year.

Now, Tesla’s execution has actually been solid this year, with earnings per share poised to almost double year-over-year, despite supply chain challenges. That said, there are multiple headwinds for the stock at present. For one, the demand picture is increasingly challenging. Tesla has slashed prices on its Model 3 and Y vehicles in the U.S. by $7,500 until the end of this year. Tesla has also resorted to discounts in China, and there are reports that the company is reducing its production schedule at its Shanghai plant for January. Price cuts of this magnitude (well over 10% of the vehicle’s sticker price) signal that demand for the company’s EVs is cooling off, meaning that Elon Musk’s forecast of 50% delivery growth over a multi-year period – a key assumption of many Tesla valuation models – looks uncertain. Separately, Elon Musk’s recent acquisition of Twitter also has big implications. Although Mr. Musk purchased the social media company in his personal capacity, the deal is clearly becoming a distraction, reducing his focus on the EV major. Although Mr. Musk has indicated that he would move away from his role as Twitter CEO, we do not think this will happen, given the sizable financial commitments he has made in the Twitter deal.",,,,

While technology names, in general, have taken a hit due to rising interest rates and concerns about the broader economy, Apple supplier stocks fell recently amid reports that demand for the latest iPhone 14 handsets, which were launched earlier this month, remains weaker than expected. Per Bloomberg, Apple has asked its suppliers to hold off on plans to raise production of the iPhone 14 series by as many as 6 million units over the second half of the year. According to the report, Apple now aims to produce about 90 million handsets for the period, roughly flat versus last year.  Moreover, Apple has essentially kept prices for its new iPhones flat over the last few years, while investors were actually expecting a price hike this time around.

However, the results mark a considerable slowdown compared to last year, with revenue growing by just 2% year-over-year with EPS also falling 7% versus the prior year due to rising operating expenses. There are multiple factors weighing on Apple’s financial performance, including the strong U.S. dollar and continuing supply chain issues, which Apple estimates hit revenue by $4 billion to $8 billion over the quarter. Moreover, the macroeconomic environment also remains tough, with U.S. GDP contracting over the last two quarters, and surging inflation eating into household budgets. Apple’s iPhone sales grew by just about 3% to $40.7 billion, and its services segment expanded by just about 12%, down from about 27% growth in the year-ago quarter, while marking the slowest quarter of growth in about six years. Apple’s iPad, Mac, and other product segments all saw revenue contract on a year-over-year basis.

For perspective, in FY’21, Apple’s revenues were up by about 40% versus 2019 levels, driven by soaring iPhone, Mac, and services sales. Apple’s margins have also expanded considerably, with gross margins as of Q2 FY’22 standing at 43.7%, driven by a more favorable product mix, higher services sales, and rising volumes, up from around 38% in FY’19. However, investors are concerned about whether the momentum will hold up. The U.S. economy could be headed into a recession, as the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates at a more aggressive pace to tame surging inflation. The central bank just carried out a 0.75% hike last week, its highest since 1994, and more similar hikes are looking likely in the coming months.  Consumer confidence is also on the decline, as surging energy, grocery, and housing prices eat into household budgets.
